# rendezvous
Rendezvous is a  web app whose front-end has been made using streamlit. It starts with the homepage which contains a dropdown menu that lets the user choose whether he wants to login or Sign-up. After having done that, the user can either type or select a movie name from the available movies. Once selected, he needs to click on the recommend button to display the stream of 5 movies (along with their posters) that fulfill the requirements of a "good-recommendation".
